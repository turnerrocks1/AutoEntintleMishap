First lets give a little back story of how it went down so yesterday 03/23/10 13 days before my bday yayyy!!!
Anyways getting off topic i wanted to install Ext3nder as i always did with all my previous jailbreaks and no im not a noob I've 
been in the Jailbreaking community since ios 3.1.3 but anyways i looked it up and came across this tweet saying by installing 
autoentitle you can install ext3nder installer so i tried it and it worked i successfully installed it and installed an ipa with ext3nder
Side note this was the version before the latest update 4.0.1 so then i updated to 4.0.1 and it worked,
but it didnt go so well see i think the problem is that the older version also changed the contents of the debs that cydia was 
installing and gave it correct entitlements that wasn't needed the newer version was supposedly made to "fix" this problem by 
automatically disabling it but see if the previous autoentitle wasn't removed properly then it would still be a running
problem so having that said i think autoentitle needs a better uninstallation script but anyways this caused many problems with 
dpkg that we're unsolvable without restoring but i wasn't going to quit their i removed dpkg and all it's
sub binaries with filza from tweakbox but it made the sitation worse n00b mistake on my part because knowing that i use linux 24/7 I
realized as soon as i clickked delete from the trash folder i was like wait dpkg is the binary that installs and uninstalls pkgs
but it was too late a second to fast after all these years i started to panic because now cydia wouldnt even install packages without
dpkg so another noob boost of energy kicked in and yes kid you not i removed cydia installer and it removed every single package
and crashed cydia so a psuedo working cydia with every app crashing even stock apps were crashing so i started to remember my apticker.der
from the /system/library/caches folder and i was releaved but im4m successfully changed it to a shsh
but tss saver by 1conan and even img4 tool that i used to make the shsh kept returning invalid blobs and i wasn't going to take a chance
and restore with invalid blobs i know project zero comes with powerful kernel exploits every few months ** and i wasnt going to 
take a chance and have to wait months for another fucking jailbreak so i grew a pair and had to figure out how to fix it myself then 
i remember ... Liberios

How to fix every problem from electra and tweaks the dangerous way

Remember Liberios yes the liberios that everyone forgot about this will become your bestfriend when your in trouble and fuck up
electra and cydia

Step 1 do something noobish like fuck up major jailbreak binaries

Step 2 download tweak box via safari 

install filzaEsxaped from tweakbox

step 3 download liberios and install with cydia impactor run liberios and click jailbreak

step 4 ** side note since openssh was installed with cydia cydia will also remove it so ... yea stfp with cyberduck won't work so youll 
have to have a linux or mac with ssh or install cygwin on windows and install openssh

step 4 go to safari and go to my me.sh and copy all the contents of the script aka "select all and copy" then open filza and go to /jb/bin
and create a file call me1.sh open it and paste everything into it and click save and done

step 5 go to your computer ssh into your device with ssh root@your-iphone-ip 

step 6 run the export path command for liberios 

step 7 type cd /jb/bin

step 8 run chmod 777 me1.sh

step 9. run rm just to see it workes

step 10 and final step . pray and type ./me1.sh and wait a few seconds and problem file a issue on this github
